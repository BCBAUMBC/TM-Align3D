## Overview

This notebook has two primary functionalities:

1. **Structure Alignment and Comparison** — Calculate **TM-score** and **RMSD** between two protein structures using **ProDy** and **tmtools**.
2. **3D Visualization** — Display aligned structures interactively with **py3Dmol**, using **biopython** for file handling and sequence parsing.

Our workflow guides users through three stages:  
- loading or fetching structures,  
- computing TM-score and RMSD for quantitative comparison, and  
- visualizing structural overlap in 3D.

We demonstrate the notebook with examples comparing the **Human apo ferritin** and a **Bullfrog M ferritin** to illustrate how TM-score and RMSD reflect global and local similarity between protein folds.

## Metrics Explained

### **TM-score**
- A **length-independent** metric that measures the topological similarity between two protein structures.
- Introduced by Yang Zhang & Jeffrey Skolnick (2005).  
  _"TM-align: a protein structure alignment algorithm based on the TM-score."_  
  **Nucleic Acids Research, 33(7), 2302–2309.**
- **Interpretation:**
  - **TM-score > 0.75** → Indicates strong similarity
  - **TM-score > 0.5** → Generally indicates similar folds.
  - **TM-score < 0.3** → Typically indicates unrelated structures.

### **RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation)**
- Measures the **average atomic deviation** between equivalent atoms after optimal superposition.
- **Lower RMSD values** indicate higher structural similarity.
- Sensitive to local deviations, while TM-score captures global fold similarity.
